# student_record_management_system
Student Record Management System: A Flask-based web app for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting student records (ID, name, age, grade) via a clean, tabbed interface.

Features include sortable tables (by column, asc/desc), inline edit modals, search with direct actions, duplicate ID checks, and responsive Bootstrap design for mobile/desktop use.

Tech stack: Python/Flask backend (in-memory storage), HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 5 frontend, Jinja2 templating, and vanilla JS for interactions—no database needed.

Setup: Clone repo, pip install flask, run python app.py, visit localhost:5000. Data resets on restart; extensible to SQLite.
